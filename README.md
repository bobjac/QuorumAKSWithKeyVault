# Introduction 
This project contains a sample for running Quorum microservices on [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes).

All microservices code will be written in dotnet core using the Nethereum.Quorum packages, and will communicate with endpoints exposed via the [Azure Blockchain Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/blockchain-service/).

This sample is not meant for production use, it is a sample.

It demonstrates the following concepts that are important in Enterprise blockchain deployments:
1. Private Key being managed by an HSM (Azure Key Vault) with the signing operations being done IN the HSM, and the key not being accessible to the application. This is facilitated through [Nethereum.Signer.AzureKeyVault](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethereum.Signer.AzureKeyVault/)

2. Creating and calling smart contracts with Quorum and Nethereum, using the ExternalAccount object with a reference to our private key (or ethereum account) that is held in KeyVault

3. A project containing a "QuorumTransactionManager" helper class that handles deployment and calling smart contracts. The class contains methods that do a variety of things asynchronously. The class is meant to be generic in that it works for ANY smart contract, so long as you supply the appropriate parameters.

With this sample, we demonstrate a scenario where the details of the Private Key are stored securely in the cloud and we create our Ethereum account on the fly from the details of that key. 

This sample is an extension of the project hosted at https://github.com/malirezai/QuorumFunctionWithKeyVault by Mahdi Alirezaie.

## Project references:

The following nuget packages are referenced: 

- [Nethereum.Quorum](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethereum.Quorum/)
- [Nethereum.Accounts](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethereum.Accounts/)
- [Nethereum.Signer.AzureKeyVault](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethereum.Signer.AzureKeyVault/)
- [Polly.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly/) for resilient APIs

## Prerequisites

This readme will not walk you through using Nethereum or setting up an Azure Blockchain service node. 

For Nethereum documentation please refer to: https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/

For setting up an Azure Blockchain service node please refer to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/service/create-member

For setting up VSCode for use with Solidtity, please download the VSCode Solidity Extension.

It is assumed that the people following this guide have a good understanding of Ethereum concepts (Contracts, functions, signing operations, nonces, submitting transactions via Web3, ect).

## What You Need to Run this Sample

This sample comes complete with a local.settings.json file that has a few Environment variables set. We really only need to set up 4 Azure services, and copy a few values to "local.settings.json"

1. An Azure Blockchain Service Node - so we have our RPC Endpoint
2. An Azure Key Vault to store our private Key 
3. A Blob storage account for storing the compiled smart contract's JSON file (that contains the bytecode and ABI)
4. An AKS cluster with AAD Pod Identity Deployed.
5. (Optional) A Service Principal for the KeyVault above so we can grab the key when deploying our function locally with an Application ID and associated Secret
